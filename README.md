A Computer Science major based in Mumbai with a strong interest in turning ideas (even unconventional ones) into functional, secure, and well-structured code. I enjoy building full-stack applications, tackling complex logic, and identifying the root cause of issues — whether it’s a stubborn bug or a hidden vulnerability.

Alongside development, I’m deeply passionate about cybersecurity — exploring ethical hacking, VAPT, and SOC operations to better understand how systems can be both built and defended. I love combining creativity, technical precision, and security awareness to craft reliable, efficient, and resilient solutions.
