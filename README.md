A Computer Science major based in Mumbai with a strong interest in turning ideas (even unconventional ones) into functional and well-structured code. I enjoy building full-stack applications, tackling complex logic, and identifying the root cause of issues, even during late-night debugging sessions.
I find the development process both challenging and rewarding, and I’m always eager to learn, refine my skills, and contribute to meaningful projects that combine creativity with technical precision.
